# Name: story_branch (recommend: setting a git alias as "git story")
#
# Author: Jason Milkins <jason@opsmanager.com> & Gabe Hollombe <gabe@neo.com>
#
# Description:
#
# Create a git branch with automatic reference to a Pivotal Tracker Story ID
#
# Commentary:
#
# By default story_branch will present a list of started
# stories from your active PivotalTracker project, you select one and
# then provide a feature branch name for that story. The branch will
# be created and the name will include the story_id as a suffix.
#
# When picking a story, enter the selection number on the left (up
# arrow / C-p will scroll through the numbers)
#
# Once a story is selected, a feature branch name must be entered, a
# suggestion is shown if you press up arrow / C-p
#
# Changelog:
#
# Milestone 'porus-flapjack' DONE
# * Present safe version of story name (dash-cased) for editing
# * Provide readline editing
#
# Milestone 'eggs-n-bakey' DONE
# * Validate that branchname is 'legal'
# * Validate that branchname doesn't already exist (strip pivotal
#   tracker ids suffix from existing names when present)
# * Use Levenshtein Distance to determine if name is (very) similar to
#   existing branch names
# * Use Git gem
# * Use ActiveSupport gem
# * Use Levenschtein-ffi gem
# * Readline history injection for story selection & branch name suggestion
#
# Milestone 'tequila-grizzly' DONE
# * Look for pivotal project id (.pivotal-id) in repo root (we assume
#   we're in project root.) (before checking environment)
#
# Backlog:
